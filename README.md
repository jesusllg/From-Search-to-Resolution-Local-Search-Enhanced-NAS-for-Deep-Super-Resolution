# From-Search-to-Resolution-Local-Search-Enhanced-NAS-for-Deep-Super-Resolution
This repository introduces the Branching Architecture Search Space (BASS) for super-resolution and presents a series of search algorithms, including Evolutionary NAS (ENAS) and Local Search techniques, to efficiently explore and optimize architectures within BASS, achieving enhanced accuracy and resource efficiency.
